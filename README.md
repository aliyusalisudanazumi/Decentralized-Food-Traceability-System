# FoodChain: Decentralized Food Traceability System

A blockchain-powered platform enabling end-to-end food traceability, safety monitoring, and quality assurance across the entire supply chain from farm to table.

## Overview

FoodChain revolutionizes food supply chain management by creating an immutable record of food products' journey, integrating IoT sensor data, and enabling rapid response to safety concerns. The system ensures transparency, reduces fraud, and builds consumer trust through verifiable data and smart contract automation.

## Core Features

### Supply Chain Tracking
- Real-time product location and condition monitoring
- Timestamped tracking of custody transfers
- Temperature and humidity logging via IoT sensors
- Automated compliance verification
- Digital certificates of origin and authenticity

### Quality Assurance
- Smart contract-based quality certification
- Automated safety protocol verification
- Real-time alerting system for condition violations
- Integration with laboratory testing results
- Historical quality data analysis

### Safety Management
- Automated recall initiation and tracking
- Rapid contamination source identification
- Smart contract-triggered safety alerts
- Stakeholder notification system
- Emergency response coordination

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- `ProductTracker.sol`: Manages product lifecycle and ownership
- `QualityCertification.sol`: Handles quality assurance and certifications
- `RecallManagement.sol`: Controls recall procedures
- `SensorIntegration.sol`: Manages IoT sensor data validation
- `PremiumOrigins.sol`: NFT system for premium products

### IoT Integration
- Temperature sensors
- Humidity monitors
- GPS tracking devices
- Storage condition sensors
- RFID/NFC readers

### Backend Components
- Node.js API server
- MongoDB for off-chain data
- IPFS for document storage
- Message queue for real-time updates
- Analytics engine

### Frontend Applications
- Web dashboard (React)
- Mobile apps (React Native)
- Scanner integration
- Real-time monitoring interface
- Stakeholder-specific views

## Data Models

### Product Record
```json
{
  "productId": "string",
  "origin": {
    "farm": "string",
    "location": "string",
    "timestamp": "date"
  },
  "certifications": ["string"],
  "transportData": [{
    "location": "string",
    "temperature": "number",
    "humidity": "number",
    "timestamp": "date"
  }]
}
```

## Smart Contract Integration

### Product Registration
```solidity
function registerProduct(
    string memory productId,
    address producer,
    string memory originData
) public returns (bool)
```

### Quality Certification
```solidity
function issueCertification(
    string memory productId,
    string memory certificationType,
    bytes memory signature
) public returns (bool)
```

## Security Features
